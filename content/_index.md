# Express Serverless Platform
## An open source, Kubernetes-native, microservices and serverless platform.

Express Serverless Platform (ESP) takes the idea behind microserivces and APIs and makes it _concrete_ and _real_.

With ESP it's easy to...

 * develop microservices - starting with existing applications and data or with something completely greenfield.
 * build and deploy your microservices into the cloud in real time
 * expose your microservices as APIs consumable by other applications or clients internally or externally

If you haven't already - please check out the [Getting Started](/basics/canvas) guide.
