Over the last few months it seems like everyone has been getting in on that hot multi-cloud action. Unlike a lot of other companies, we&#8217;ve been cloud agnostic since day one ([_before it was cool_][1]). So for LunchBadger, we&#8217;d like like to take a moment and get on the mic about what this is really all about and how you can use a multi-cloud strategy to achieve maximum growth, sustainably.

## What does multi-cloud mean?

First of all, &#8220;hybrid&#8221; and multi-cloud are not the same thing. This might seem obvious, but we&#8217;ve seen a few shifty articles out there that try to mix up the terms. It&#8217;s also very easy to see how the two terms can get confusing.

  * **Hybrid cloud model:** You use a cloud computing environment that is a mix of an on-prem/private cloud and a public cloud, with orchestration between each of them
  * **Multi-cloud:** You use several public cloud providers representing a general approach to managing cloud services for your company

It&#8217;s true, hybrid cloud model could be part of a multi-cloud deployment &#8211; but it&#8217;s important to recognize the difference in the two terms which represent different types of architecture.

## Why does multi-cloud matter?

Multi-cloud isn&#8217;t just for the big enterprise and there are benefits that provide value even without large scale operations.

Here are some of the most common:

  * avoiding pesky and expensive vendor lock-in
  * finding optimal cloud services for a particular business or technical need
  * increased redundancy

Most importantly, **speed and agility** is a massive benefit with a multi-cloud strategy. This is an aspect that is not commonly considered, but should be put front and center. Businesses are facing more pressure from the market and consumers. Even if you&#8217;re a B2B company, the B2C companies you sell to are being affected by consumer demand and changing global waves of innovation or regulation. So when you think about the agility and speed that a multi cloud environment can give you, these factors are at the core of it&#8217;s disruptive potential.

## Companies using a multi-cloud strategy to get ahead

Almost every enterprise using a cloud or hybrid storage model has a multi-cloud strategy. This is why the multi-cloud fever has hit so hard. It&#8217;s just a term that encapsulates the pressures that enterprise have been feeling for a long time. So if you&#8217;re considering a multi-cloud strategy, you&#8217;ve got a path of giants you can follow.

> “We recognized that we were spending a lot of time, energy, effort and management bandwidth to create infrastructure that already exists out there in a much better state and is evolving at a furious pace,” [says Capital One CIO Rob Alexander][2].

Additionally, a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52045" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">study</a> of 1,734 companies paid for by Microsoft and conducted by 451 Research LLC in 2016, found many flavors of hybrid cloud formations emerging.  With 74% of these companies managing on-premises private clouds with hosted private clouds. Additionally, just about 50% maintained on-prem private clouds with public clouds, and 33% managed hosted private clouds in conjunction with public cloud services. These are just a few tasty numbers that you should know.

## New Partnership with Joyent

If you&#8217;re curious or feeling the burn for multi-cloud, we&#8217;ve got more for you. Learn all about our partnership with Joyent (also [featured on Containerworld,][4] many more!). T<span style="font-weight: 400;">ogether with Joyent, we’re upping the game with a simple, yet flexible, alternative to managing virtual applications across multiple providers. </span>

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Press Release:</span>_

> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our partnership with LunchBadger is the foundational third pillar of our open cloud strategy. The LunchBadger Serverless platform has been designed to be cloud agnostic and Kubernetes native. They are the ideal partner for us to build out Open Services like api-gateways, functional microservices, databases and event-streams, all running serverless across multiple clouds. This will provide a viable option to customers seeking to break free from the lock-in of proprietary ‘as a service’ offerings of cloud providers.” &#8211; Shubhra Kar, VP of Product, Joyent.</span>

Also, this partnership is more than just two companies going out for a picnic. We&#8217;ve also sponsored [Express Gateway][5], an open source API Gateway built entirely on Express.js. So, in case you couldn&#8217;t tell &#8211; **APIs and Microservices in the Enterprise is our bag** and we&#8217;re looking forward to understanding more about your use case for multi-cloud.
